1744,1744,32647289,Development and validation of a nomogram prognostic model for esophageal cancer patients with oligometastases.,,[],"Platinum-based chemotherapy is recommended as the standard treatment for metastatic esophageal cancer (EC) patients; however, the outcome is poor. Oligometastasis is less aggressive and has limited growth potential. However, the prognostic factors for EC patients with oligometastases was largely unknown. Thus, we intend to determine the prognostic factors, and develop and validate nomograms for prediction of survival for EC patients with oligometastases. In this study, characteristics of 273 oligometastatic EC patients were analyzed using univariate and multivariate Cox models to determine the independent prognostic factors for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The result showed that history of alcohol consumption, longer tumor, no local radiotherapy for EC, and no local treatment for metastases were independent factors for PFS. Sex, esophageal fistula, number of metastatic organs, and local radiotherapy for EC were independent prognostic factors for OS. On the basis of Cox models, the respective nomogram for prediction of PFS and OS was established with the corrected concordance index of 0.739 and 0.696 after internal cross-validation. In conclusion, local treatment for metastases and local radiotherapy for EC were demonstrated to be beneficial for oligometastatic EC patients, and the validated nomograms are valuable in prognosis prediction and could guide individualized management for these patients."
1821,1821,32642255,"Noninvasive biomarkers for lung cancer diagnosis, where do we stand?",,"['Indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs)', 'biomarkers', 'management', 'prediction']","The 2010's saw demonstration of the power of lung cancer screening to reduce mortality. However, with implementation of lung cancer screening comes the challenge of diagnosing millions of lung nodules every year. When compared to other cancers with widespread screening strategies (breast, colorectal, cervical, prostate, and skin), obtaining a lung nodule tissue biopsy to confirm a positive screening test remains associated with higher morbidity and cost. Therefore, non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers may have a unique opportunity in lung cancer to greatly improve the management of patients at risk. This review covers recent advances in the field of liquid biomarkers and computed tomographic imaging features, with special attention to new methods for combination of biomarkers as well as the use of artificial intelligence for the discrimination of benign from malignant nodules."
1904,1904,32637176,A Systematic Review of the Prevalence and Diagnostic Workup of PIK3CA Mutations in HR+/HER2- Metastatic Breast Cancer.,,[],"PIK3CA mutation frequency varies among breast cancer (BC) subtypes. Recent evidence suggests combination therapy with the PI3K inhibitor (PI3Ki) alpelisib and endocrine therapy (ET) improves response rates and progression-free survival (PFS) in <i>PIK3CA</i>-mutant, hormone receptor positive (HR+) BC versus ET alone; thus, better understanding the clinical and epidemiologic elements of these mutations is warranted. This systematic review characterizes the <i>PIK3CA</i> mutation epidemiology, type of testing approaches (e.g., liquid or tissue tumor biopsy), and stability/concordance (e.g., consistency in results by liquid versus solid tumor sample, by the same method over time) in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced (locally unresectable) or metastatic disease (HR+/HER2- mBC) and explores performance (e.g., pairwise concordance, sensitivity, specificity, or predictive value) of respective mutation findings. A comprehensive search of PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, and select conference abstracts (i.e., AACR, ASCO, SABCS, ECCO, and ESMO conferences between 2014 and 2017) identified 39 studies of patients with HR+, HER2- mBC. The median prevalence of <i>PIK3CA</i> mutation was 36% (range: 13.3% to 61.5%); identified testing approaches more commonly used tissue over liquid biopsies and primarily utilized next-generation sequencing (NGS), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or Sanger sequencing. There was concordance and stability between tissues (range: 70.4% to 94%) based on limited data. Given the clinical benefit of the PI3Ki alpelisib in patients with PIK3CA mutant HR+/HER2- mBC, determination of tumor <i>PIK3CA</i> mutation status is of importance in managing patients with HR+/HER2- mBC. Prevalence of this mutation and utility of test methodologies likely warrants <i>PIK3CA</i> mutation testing in all patients with this breast cancer subtype via definitive assessment of PIK3CA mutational status."

Cardio-toxicity among patients with breast cancer is well studied but the impact on patients with sarcoma is limited, even though they are exposed to higher ANT doses. The commonly used term for cardio-toxicity is cancer therapeutics related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD), defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) reduction of > 10%, to a value below 53%. The aim of our study was to estimate the prevalence of CTRCD in patients diagnosed with sarcoma and to describe the baseline risk factors and echocardiography parameters among that population."
2849,2849,32578005,Pure ground glass opacity (GGO) on chest CT: a rare presentation of lung metastasis of Malignant Phyllodes Tumor.,,"['Ground glass opacity', 'Lung metastasis', 'Phyllodes tumor', 'Surgical resection']","Lung is the most common target organ for distant metastasis of phyllodes tumor (PT), where the metastatic tumors are mostly seen as nodules or masses. We report here a rare case in which pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) was observed on chest CT about 3 years after the initial treatment of breast PT. After the lung lobectomy, we histologically confirmed that it should be diagnosed as a metastasis of PT. GGO rarely shows on metastatic tumors, and no reports have been made on GGO thus far in connection with metastasis of PT. Thus, in case GGO was found on the CT of patients having a history of PT, we suggest to take possible distant-metastasis into consideration."

3189,3189,32559121,Application and Evaluation of [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]-Labeled Peptide Nucleic Acid Targeting <i>MicroRNA-155</i> in Breast Cancer Imaging.,,"['99mTc, molecular imaging', 'breast cancer', 'miR-155', 'peptide nucleic acid (PNA)']","It has been reported that dysregulation of <i>microRNA-155</i> expression and function is associated with tumorigenesis, growth, tumor subtypes, invasion, and poor survival rates. Peptide nucleic acid (PNA), an artificially synthesized nucleic acid mimic, has been applied for molecular diagnosis. In this study, a PNA sequence that undergoes complementary binding to <i>miR-155</i> was labeled with <sup>99m</sup>Tc to evaluate whether the tracer could visualize the expression of <i>miR-155</i> in breast cancer. Both antisense PNA (anti-PNA, fully complementary bound to human mature <i>miR-155</i>, referred to as ""anti-PNA-155"") and mismatched PNA (referred to as ""mis-PNA"") single strands containing 23-mer were synthesized. The relative expression of <i>miR-155</i> in MCF-7 cells and tumors was higher than that in MDA-MB-231 cells and tumors. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan showed that radioactivity mainly accumulated in kidney. MCF-7 tumors, but not MDA-MB-231 tumors, were clearly visualized after [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]anti-PNA-155 injection. MCF-7 tumors were less visible when coinjected with 100-fold excess of anti-PNA-155 or injected with [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]mis-PNA, which suggested specific binding. Biodistribution study results were consistent with SPECT imaging. We successfully demonstrated that [<sup>99m</sup>Tc]anti-PNA-155 could visualize <i>miR-155</i> expression in vivo, suggesting it may be a promising probe applied in breast cancer."

In our effort to characterize LS families from Latin America, this study aimed to describe the spectrum of neoplasms and cancer risk by gender, age and gene, and survival in 34 Chilean LS families. Of them, 59% harbored <i>path_MLH1</i>, 23% <i>path_MSH2</i>, 12% <i>path_PMS2</i> and 6% <i>path_EPCAM</i> variants. A total of 866 individuals at risk were identified, of which 213 (24.6%) developed 308 neoplasms. In males, CRC was the most common cancer (72.6%), while females showed a greater frequency of extracolonic cancers (58.4%), including uterus and breast (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). The cumulative incidence of extracolonic cancers was higher in females than males (<i>p</i> = 0.001). <i>Path_MLH1</i> variants are significantly more associated with the development of CRC than extracolonic tumors (59.5% vs. 40.5%) when compared to <i>path_MSH2</i> (47.5% vs. 52.5%) variants (<i>p</i> = 0.05018). The cumulative incidence of CRC was higher in <i>path_MLH1</i>/<i>path_MSH2</i> carriers compared to <i>path_PMS2</i> carriers (<i>p</i> = 0.03). In addition, <i>path_MSH2</i> carriers showed higher risk of extracolonic tumors (<i>p</i> = 0.002). In conclusion, this study provides a snapshot of the LS profile from Chile and the current LS-associated diagnostic practice and output in Chile. Categorizing cancer risks associated with each population is relevant in the genetic counselling of LS patients."

4391,4391,32485532,"Expanding the anticancer potential of 1,2,3-triazoles via simultaneously targeting Cyclooxygenase-2, 15-lipoxygenase and tumor-associated carbonic anhydrases.",,"['1,2,3-Triazoles', '15-Lipoxygenase', 'Apoptosis', 'Cancer', 'Carbonic anhydrase', 'Cyclooxygenase-2', 'MTDL']","Cancer is a multifactorial disorder involving multiplicity of interrelated signaling pathways and molecular targets. To that end, a multi-target design strategy was adopted to develop some 1,2,3-triazoles hybridized with some pharmacophoric anticancer fragments, as first-in-class simultaneous inhibitors of COX-2, 15-LOX and tumor associated carbonic anhydrase enzymes. Results revealed that compounds 5a, 5d, 8b and 8c were potent inhibitors of COX-2 and 15-LOX enzymes. COX-2 inhibitory activity was further demonstrated by the inhibition of the accumulation of 6-keto-PGF1α, a metabolite of COX-2 products in two cancer cell lines. The sulfonamide bearing derivatives 5d and 8c were effective nanomolar and submicromolar inhibitors of tumor associated hCA XII isoform, respectively. Strong to moderate inhibitory activities were observed in the in vitro antiproliferative assay on lung (A549), liver (HepG2) and breast (MCF7) cancer cell lines (IC<sub>50</sub> 2.37-28.5 μM) with high safety margins on WI-38 cells. A cytotoxic advantage of CA inhibition was observed as an increased activity against tumor cell lines expressing CA IX/XII. Further mechanistic clues for the anticancer activities of compound 5a and its sulfonamide analog 5d were derived from induction of cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. They also triggered apoptosis via increasing expression levels of caspase-9 and Bax together with suppressing that of Bcl-2. The in vitro anti-tumor activity was reflected as reduced tumor size upon treatment with 8c in an in vivo cancer xenograft model. Docking experiments on the target enzymes supported their in vitro data and served as further molecular evidence. In silico calculations and ligand efficiency indices were promising. In light of these data, such series could offer new structural insights into the understanding and development of multi-target COX-2/15-LOX/hCA inhibitors for anticancer outcomes."

The highest MAE-yield (14.47%) was optimized at 457.32 W and 75 °C for 26 min. The extracted crude polysaccharides were purified using ion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatographies and eluted a single symmetrical narrow peak, showing a homogenous fraction (MRP-P1) with a molecular weight of 4.87 × 10<sup>4</sup> Da. The surface morphology of polysaccharides and functional groups of MRP-P1 were determined by employing scanning electron microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, respectively. The major monosaccharide composition of MRPs were the three monomers of rhamnose, galactose, and glucose. The antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antitumor activities were increased in a concentration-dependent manner (1.0-10.0 mg/mL). MRP-P1 exhibited a strong in vitro antiproliferative activity against lung (A549), liver (HepG2), and breast (MCF-7) cancer cells. The anticancer activity of polysaccharides extracted under optimal MAE conditions was highly associated with their antioxidant and antibacterial functions."
4896,4896,32449691,Leptin decreases BC cell susceptibility to NK lysis via PGC1A pathway.,,"['PGC-1α', 'breast cancer', 'leptin', 'tumor immune escape', 'β oxidation']","Large prospective studies established a link between obesity and breast cancer (BC) development. Yet, the mechanisms underlying this association are not fully understood. Among the diverse adipocytokine secreted by hypertrophic adipose tissue, leptin is emerging as a key candidate molecule linking obesity and cancer, since it promotes proliferation and invasiveness of tumors. However, the potential implication of leptin on tumor escape mechanisms remains unknown. This study aims to explore the effect of leptin on tumor resistance to NK lysis and the underlying mechanism. We found that leptin promotes both BC resistance to NK92-mediated lysis and β oxidation on MCF-7, by the up-regulation of a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor coactivator-1 α (PGC1A). Using adenoviral approaches, we show that acute elevation of PGC1A enhances the fatty acid oxidation pathway and decreases the susceptibility of BC cells to NK92-mediated lysis. Importantly, we identified the involvement of PGC1A and leptin in the regulation of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1A) expression by tumor cells. We further demonstrate that basal BC cells MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 exhibit an increased PGC1A mRNA level and an enhanced oxidative phosphorylation activity; in comparison with luminal BC cells MCF7 and MDA-361, which are associated with more resistance NK92 lysis. Altogether, our results demonstrate for the first time how leptin could promote tumor resistance to immune attacks. Reagents blocking leptin or PGC1A activity might aid in developing new therapeutic strategies to limit tumor development in obese BC patients."

Despite this progress, additional kinase inhibitors are needed to expand the target space as well as overcome drug resistance that has emerged in clinical setting. Here, we developed KiDNN (Kinase inhibitor prediction using Deep Neural Networks). KiDNN utilizes non-linear, multilayer feedforward network that mimics complex and dynamic kinase-driven signaling pathways. We used KiDNN to predict the effect of ∼200 kinase inhibitors on migration of breast and liver cancer cells. We show that the prediction accuracy of KiDNN outperformed other prediction tools based on linear models. We validated that an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase receptors, and an inhibitor of Src family kinases, decreased migration of triple-negative breast cancer cells, consistent with the role of these kinases in driving motility. Overall, we show that non-linear, DNN-based models provide a powerful approach to in silico screen hundreds of kinase inhibitors."

We report that a poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) mesh implant containing a collagen sponge (CS) maintained the internal space in vivo for up to 12 months and substituted for adipose tissue. We developed a PLLA capsule that maintained the internal space longer than that of PLLA mesh and compared adipose tissue formation at 12 and 24 months after implantation between the PLLA mesh with CS implant and the PLLA capsule implant with or without CS in a rabbit model. After 12 months, all implants maintained the internal space, and the adipose tissue that formed in all implant groups was larger than that in the control group. At 24 months, PLLA mesh maintained the internal space just as well as that at 12 months, while the PLLA capsule collapsed and accumulated a large number of macrophages. The formed adipose tissue in the PLLA mesh group was maintained up to 24 months; however, those in two PLLA capsule groups decreased and showed no difference from the control group. In conclusion, the internal space of the PLLA mesh implant with CS was substituted for adipose tissue at 12 months and sustained the formed adipose tissue after 24 months. The PLLA mesh implant containing CS is a desirable bioabsorbable implant that can be replaced by autologous adipose tissue after implantation in vivo without using any growth factors or cells."
